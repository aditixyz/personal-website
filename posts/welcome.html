            â€‹hey! i'm aditi, and i'm glad you stumbled on this page. life's too short. so let's skip the small talk anyway.<br><br> here's the thing: humans are compelled to think, personally, i think a lot. it's bizarre how we're always thinking about something. we can never shut off our minds. we just keep on chugging, even when we're in bed trying to sleep. i have found that if we write down our thoughts, we discover how little we know about what we think, which is amazing and empowering at the same time. <br><br>as of now, i'm hoping to publish them here. since you canâ€™t choose what youâ€™re going to write about perfectly in advance, i'll assume that you'll enjoy reading this, as much as i will writing. <br><br>typical posts include personal observations of life, some of which are written in an intentionally intellectual way to make you question the meaning of life (and my sanity). i'll occasionally rant about how tech companies are ruining our culture, and also how they're making it possible to have the best time of your life. i know the odds are that if you're here, you're probably not looking for serious content, so if you want me to just crack jokes all the time, just let me know.
